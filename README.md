# SDLC Agent Team Framework

> A reusable framework for building software with **Claude Code Agent Teams**.
> Each AI agent plays a specialized role (PO, DEV, QA...) and they coordinate through shared files — just like a real dev team.
>
> Works for any project: SaaS, API, mobile backend, e-commerce, chat app, dashboard...

## 1. Setup & Configuration

### 1.1 Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or VS Code Extension
- Git (recommended)
- Runtime for your tech stack (Python, Node.js, Go, etc.)

### 1.2 Enable Agent Teams

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
claude
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS = "1"
claude
```

**Windows (CMD):**
```cmd
set CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
claude
```

### 1.3 Model Configuration

> **Provider:** This template uses Claude Code's native `Agent` tool, which only spawns **Anthropic** models (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku). To use ChatGPT or Gemini, you'd need a different orchestrator (LangGraph, CrewAI, custom multi-provider setup) — that is outside the scope of this template.

#### Team Lead (your main session)
```bash
/model opus          # Orchestrator should use the most capable model
```

#### Per-agent model assignment

Models are configured in **[.agent_team/agents_config.md](.agent_team/agents_config.md)** — one file, one place to change.

To switch a model: open that file, edit the `Model` column for the agent you want to change, save. Agents read this file when spawned.

#### Recommended assignment

| Agent | Model | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **Team Lead** | `opus` | Complex coordination, architecture decisions |
| **PO Agent** | `opus` | Deep requirement analysis, edge case thinking |
| **Architect Agent** | `opus` | API contract + tech design, decisions costly to change |
| **Designer Agent** | `sonnet` | Translate design refs → spec; pattern-matching task |
| **DEV Agent** | `sonnet` | Fast code generation, good quality |
| **Flutter Agent** | `sonnet` | Mobile code generation; same reasoning as DEV |
| **QA Agent** | `sonnet` | Test execution, code review patterns |
| **DevOps Agent** | `sonnet` | Push to GitHub, Vercel deploy — formulaic |
| **Security Agent** | `opus` | Vulnerability analysis needs deep reasoning |

> **Available aliases:** `opus` (most capable), `sonnet` (balanced), `haiku` (fastest/cheapest). Aliases auto-resolve to the latest version — pin a specific version (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`) only if you need reproducibility.
>
> **Rule of thumb:** Use `opus` for agents that *think* (PO, Security, Architect). Use `sonnet` for agents that *execute* (DEV, QA, DevOps).

### 1.4 MCP Configuration

Some agents call external tools via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io):

| Agent | MCP server | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Designer Agent | `figma` *(optional)* | Pull design frames if no `docs/design_input/` files are provided |
| Architect Agent | `supabase` *(if DB)* | Inspect / propose schema |
| DEV Agent | `supabase` *(if DB)* | Run migrations, seed data |
| Flutter Agent | `supabase` *(if DB)* | Same — for mobile apps that talk directly to Supabase |
| DevOps Agent | `github` | Push code, create CI workflow, set branch protection |
| DevOps Agent | `vercel` *(web)* | Link project, set env vars, trigger production deploy |

**Setup (one-time per project):**

1. **Create the resources** (you do this manually, *not* the agent):
   - Figma file with your designs.
   - GitHub repo (empty is fine — DevOps will populate it).
   - Vercel project linked to that repo.
2. **Generate tokens:**
   - **Figma:** [Personal Access Token](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens) (read-only is enough).
   - **GitHub:** [Fine-scoped PAT](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens) with `repo` + `workflow` scopes.
   - **Vercel:** [Access Token](https://vercel.com/account/tokens).
   - **Supabase** *(only if project uses Supabase):* [Personal Access Token](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens).
3. **Configure secrets:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then edit .env and paste in the three tokens
   ```
4. **Update [`.mcp.json`](.mcp.json)** — replace `<team-slug>/<project-slug>` in the `vercel` server URL with your actual Vercel team and project slugs.
5. **Fill in [project_description.md §5](.agent_team/project_description.md)** — Figma URL, GitHub repo URL, default branch, Vercel slugs. Agents read this to know which resources to use.
6. **Restart Claude Code** — `.mcp.json` is loaded at startup, so the servers won't be available until you restart.

> `.env` is gitignored. Never commit it. The `.env.example` file is safe to commit.
>
> **Skip what you don't need:**
> - Backend-only project → leave `FIGMA_API_KEY` blank and skip the Designer Agent.
> - Not deploying yet → leave the GitHub / Vercel tokens blank and skip the DevOps Agent.
> - Not using Supabase → leave `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` blank.
> - Mobile-only project → no Vercel needed; you only need GitHub + (later) Apple Developer / Google Play credentials in **GitHub Secrets** (not `.env`) for CI builds.

### 2.2 Agent Roles

| Agent | Role | Input | Output | MCP |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-----|
| **Team Lead** | Orchestrate, spawn agents, compile reports | User request | Final report | — |
| **PO Agent** | Analyze requirements, write User Stories | `project_description.md` + `docs/po_input/` | `docs/user_stories.md` | — |
| **Architect Agent** | Define API contract + cross-cutting tech design + DB schema | User Stories + tech stack | `docs/api_contract.md` (+ `docs/tech_design.md`) | `supabase` *(if DB)* |
| **Designer Agent** | Translate design refs + user stories into UI spec | User Stories + `docs/design_input/` (or Figma) | `docs/design_spec.md` (+ `docs/design_assets/`) | `figma` *(optional)* |
| **DEV Agent** | Code backend + web frontend + tests | User Stories + API contract + Design spec | Source code in `backend/`, `frontend/` + tests | `supabase` *(if DB)* |
| **Flutter Agent** | Code mobile app + tests; APK locally, IPA via CI | User Stories + API contract + Design spec | Source code in `mobile/` + tests | `supabase` *(if DB)* |
| **QA Agent** | Run tests (Playwright + Flutter integration_test), review code, report bugs | Source code | `docs/qa_report.md` | — |
| **DevOps Agent** | Push to GitHub + CI; deploy web to Vercel and/or set up mobile CI for TestFlight/Play Console | Source code + QA pass | `docs/deployment.md` | `github`, `vercel` |

### 2.3 Communication

Agents communicate through **shared files**, not conversation:

```
.agent_team/
├── project_description.md ← Project kickoff config (you fill this in)
├── task_board.md          ← Task tracking + message log (main hub)
└── decisions.md           ← (Optional) Architecture Decision Records
```

**Message flow:**
```
Team Lead ──→ ALL:                   "Project kickoff"
PO Agent  ──→ Architect + Designer:  "User stories ready"        (Phase 1 done)
Architect ──→ DEV / Flutter:         "API contract ready"        (Phase 2a done)
Designer  ──→ DEV / Flutter:         "Design spec ready"         (Phase 2b done)
DEV Agent ──→ Flutter / QA:          "Web code complete"         (Phase 3a done)*
Flutter   ──→ QA Agent:              "Mobile code complete"      (Phase 3b done)*
QA Agent  ──→ Team Lead:              "QA complete — see report" (Phase 4 done)
Team Lead ──→ User (HUMAN GATE):     "Interim report ready —     (Phase 5)
                                      deploy? yes / no / fix X"
   ↓ user says "yes, deploy"
Team Lead ──→ DevOps Agent:          "Approved — go ship"        (Phase 6)
DevOps    ──→ Team Lead:             "Shipped — see deployment"  (Phase 7 done)
Team Lead ──→ User:                   Final summary               (Phase 8)

* Phase 3a/3b only when project has both web + mobile. Web-only skips Flutter; mobile-only skips DEV.
```

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Copy this template

```bash
# Copy the template folder to your new project
cp -r agentteam_demoproject/ /path/to/my-new-project/
cd /path/to/my-new-project/
```

### Step 2: Fill in the project description and (optionally) tweak agents

You only **must** edit one file:

- **[.agent_team/project_description.md](.agent_team/project_description.md)** — replace every `[...]` placeholder (overview, tech stack, constraints). This is the single source of truth the agent team reads at kickoff.

Optional, only if you want to customize:

- **[.agent_team/agents_config.md](.agent_team/agents_config.md)** — change which model each agent uses.
- **[.agent_team/agents/](.agent_team/agents/)** — edit any `<NAME>_agent.md` to change agent behavior, or add a new file for a new role.
- **[.mcp.json](.mcp.json) + `.env`** — only if you're using the Designer or DevOps agents. See [§1.4](#14-mcp-configuration).

> **Don't have a fully-formed project description yet?** Skip this step. Write just a paragraph or two of your rough idea anywhere (or hold it in your head), and use **Step 4** below — PO and Architect will help flesh it out before any code is written.

### Step 3: Start Claude Code

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
claude
```

### Step 4: (Optional) Scope the project with PO + Architect

**When to use:** your `project_description.md` is rough, you haven't picked a tech stack, or you want a fresh perspective before committing.
**When to skip:** `project_description.md` is already filled in carefully — go straight to Step 5.

Paste this prompt (with your rough idea pasted between the markers at the bottom):

```
SCOPING — refine .agent_team/project_description.md before Phase 1.

I have a rough project idea, not a fleshed-out spec. Help me turn it into a
clear project_description.md by working with PO Agent and Architect Agent.

Process:
1. Spawn PO Agent (opus) and Architect Agent (opus) IN PARALLEL. Override
   their normal instructions for this round only:

   "You are in SCOPING MODE. DO NOT write docs/user_stories.md or
    docs/api_contract.md yet. Read .agent_team/project_description.md
    (it has [...] placeholders) and .agent_team/agents/<your-agent>.md
    for your role context.

    PO Agent: propose concrete values for §1 Project Overview (name,
    one-line summary, description, goals, out-of-scope). List 3–5
    clarifying questions whose answers would meaningfully change the
    proposal.

    Architect Agent: propose concrete values for §2 Tech Stack (web
    yes/no, mobile yes/no, backend, frontend, database) and a skeleton
    for §5 External resources and §6 Constraints. List 3–5 clarifying
    questions about scale, deployment target, security, compliance.

    Both: report back to Team Lead in chat. Be concrete (real values,
    not '[...]'). Do NOT touch project_description.md yet."

2. Combine their proposals + questions into one short message for me.
   Wait for my answers.

3. After I answer, update .agent_team/project_description.md with the
   refined values. Show me what changed. Ask: "Approve and start Phase 1,
   or refine more?"

4. If I say "refine more" — loop back to step 1 with my new feedback.
   If I say "approve" — run the regular kickoff prompt from Step 5 below
   to begin Phase 1.

My rough idea:
=== START ===
[describe the project freely — a paragraph or two is enough.
 don't worry about tech stack or scope; the agents will probe.]
=== END ===
```

**What you'll see:**

1. ~30 seconds later, PO and Architect both report back with concrete proposals + 3–5 questions each.
2. You answer the questions in one short reply (bullet points are fine).
3. Team Lead writes the refined values into `project_description.md` and shows you the diff.
4. You either say *"approve"* (Team Lead runs the kickoff prompt automatically) or *"refine: change X to Y"* to loop again.

**Tip:** mid-scoping you can always change direction — say *"actually drop mobile, web only"* or *"shrink scope to MVP only"* and the loop adjusts. No code has been written yet, so changes are free.

### Step 5: Kick off the agent team

If you skipped Step 4, paste this short, **fixed** prompt into Claude Code — no editing needed:

```
Read .agent_team/project_description.md and build the agent team described there.

- Read .agent_team/agents_config.md to get the model for each agent — pass that exact model when spawning.
- For each agent, read its instruction file in .agent_team/agents/ (e.g. agents/PO_agent.md) and use it as the agent's system prompt.
- Before spawning Designer or DevOps agents: verify the MCP servers they need are available and the resources in project_description.md §5 (Figma URL, GitHub repo, Vercel slugs) are filled in. If not, skip that agent and note it in the report.
- Follow the Process section of project_description.md in order.
- Create .agent_team/task_board.md as the shared coordination file; agents communicate only through that file.
- Each agent must update the task board's messages table when its phase completes.
- AFTER QA: compile docs/interim_report.md, then STOP and ask the user whether to proceed with DevOps deployment. Do NOT spawn DevOps Agent until the user explicitly says yes.
- AFTER DevOps (only if user approved): compile docs/final_report.md.
```

If you used Step 4, the scoping flow runs this prompt automatically once you say "approve" — you don't need to paste it again.

The same prompt is reusable across projects: only the contents of `.agent_team/` change.

### Step 6: Interact while running

You can intervene at any time during execution:

| What you want | Example prompt |
|---------------|----------------|
| Check progress | `"What's the current status?"` |
| Change requirements | `"Add feature X to the user stories"` |
| Ask a specific agent | `"Have DEV Agent explain the auth flow"` |
| Request a fix | `"QA found a bug, have DEV fix it"` |
| Add a new agent | `"Spawn a Security Agent to do an OWASP review"` |
| See reports | `"Summarize the QA report"` |

---

## 4. Agent Instructions

Each agent's instructions live in its own file under `.agent_team/agents/`. Edit these files to change agent behavior — Team Lead reads them when spawning each sub-agent.

| Agent | Instruction file |
|-------|------------------|
| PO Agent | [.agent_team/agents/PO_agent.md](.agent_team/agents/PO_agent.md) |
| Architect Agent | [.agent_team/agents/Architect_agent.md](.agent_team/agents/Architect_agent.md) |
| Designer Agent | [.agent_team/agents/Designer_agent.md](.agent_team/agents/Designer_agent.md) |
| DEV Agent | [.agent_team/agents/DEV_agent.md](.agent_team/agents/DEV_agent.md) |
| Flutter Agent | [.agent_team/agents/Flutter_agent.md](.agent_team/agents/Flutter_agent.md) |
| QA Agent | [.agent_team/agents/QA_agent.md](.agent_team/agents/QA_agent.md) |
| DevOps Agent | [.agent_team/agents/DevOps_agent.md](.agent_team/agents/DevOps_agent.md) |

To add a new agent: create `.agent_team/agents/<NAME>_agent.md`, add a row to [.agent_team/agents_config.md](.agent_team/agents_config.md), and reference it in [.agent_team/project_description.md](.agent_team/project_description.md) §3.

## 6. Scaling & Adding Agents

### 6.1 Add New Agents On-the-fly

Spawn any new agent at any time during the project:

```
Spawn a [AGENT NAME] to [TASK DESCRIPTION].
Use model: [opus/sonnet/haiku].
Read context from .agent_team/task_board.md and docs/.
When done, update task_board.md.
```

**Available agent types** (the default flow already includes PO, Architect, Designer, DEV, QA, DevOps — the table below covers add-ons):

| Agent | When to use | Suggested model |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Security Agent** | Production app, compliance, auth-heavy | opus |
| **DBA Agent** | Complex DB, migrations, query tuning | sonnet |
| **Tech Writer Agent** | Need API docs, user guide, READMEs | sonnet |
| **Perf Agent** | App is slow, need benchmarks | sonnet |
| **Refactor Agent** | Tech debt cleanup | sonnet |

### 6.2 Add New Phases

Extend the workflow by adding phases to the task board:

```markdown
### Phase 6: Security Review (Security Agent)
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 scan
- [ ] Auth/authz review
- [ ] Secrets management check

### Phase 7: Performance (Perf Agent)
- [ ] Benchmark critical endpoints
- [ ] Load test under expected concurrency
- [ ] Identify and document bottlenecks
```

Prompt to add:
```
Add Phase 6: Security Review to the project.
Spawn a Security Agent (model: opus) to run an OWASP Top 10 review and check auth/secrets handling.
Update task_board.md with the new phase.
```

### 6.3 Handle New Features on Existing Project

**Add a new feature (full cycle):**
```
Add [FEATURE DESCRIPTION] to the existing project.
1. PO Agent (model: opus): add new User Stories to docs/user_stories.md
2. Architect Agent (model: opus): update docs/api_contract.md for the new endpoints
3. DEV Agent (model: sonnet): implement the feature, add tests
4. QA Agent (model: sonnet): run all tests (regression + new), update report
```

**Fix a bug (targeted):**
```
QA found a bug: [BUG DESCRIPTION].
Have DEV Agent (model: sonnet) fix it, then QA Agent verify.
```

**Refactor (no new features):**
```
Spawn a Refactor Agent (model: sonnet) to:
- Review code quality in backend/
- Refactor and improve
- Run all tests to ensure no regressions
```

### 6.4 Scaling DEV — Multiple DEV Agents in Parallel

The default flow uses one DEV Agent. For large projects (~50+ user stories or genuinely independent feature sets), you can split implementation across multiple DEV agents running in parallel. This is **not** the default — pull this pattern only when you actually need it. Adding multi-DEV to a small project costs more tokens, surfaces integration bugs, and rarely speeds anything up because Architect's planning overhead grows.

**When it pays off:**
- The product has clear, independent features (e.g. `auth`, `products`, `orders`, `notifications`) where each owns its own files and routes.
- A single DEV would push the context window or take many turns.
- Microservices or modular monoliths where modules don't share much code.

**When it doesn't:**
- A small CRUD app — just use one DEV.
- Features with heavy shared utilities, shared models, or shared state — the integration friction outweighs the parallelism.
- Backend-only with one resource type — overkill.

**Pattern: vertical slicing by feature**

Each DEV owns a feature end-to-end: its routes, its models, its tests. Two DEVs never write to the same file.

1. **At Phase 2**, ask Architect to add an *Implementation Plan* section to `docs/tech_design.md`:

   ```
   Architect Agent: in addition to the API contract, write an Implementation Plan in
   docs/tech_design.md that splits work into N independent slices. For each slice list:
     - Slice name (e.g. "auth", "products")
     - User stories it covers (US-N references)
     - API endpoints it owns
     - File paths it is allowed to write to (so slices don't overlap)
     - Shared utilities it may READ but not modify
   ```

2. **At Phase 3**, ask Team Lead to spawn one DEV per slice in parallel:

   ```
   Spawn one DEV Agent (model: sonnet) per slice in docs/tech_design.md's Implementation Plan.
   Run them in parallel. Each DEV gets:
     - Its slice name, user stories, endpoints, allowed file paths
     - Read access to docs/ and to other slices' files (read-only)
     - The full api_contract.md and design_spec.md
   Each DEV updates task_board.md with its slice ID when complete.
   ```

3. **QA still runs once** at Phase 4 against the combined output. Add an extra acceptance check: cross-slice integration tests (does auth + products work together?).

**Rules of thumb:**

| Project size | DEV count |
|--------------|-----------|
| < 30 user stories | 1 (default) |
| 30–80 stories, clean feature boundaries | 2–3 |
| 80+ stories, microservices | 4+ — also consider a DEV Lead agent |

**Cost vs. benefit:** N parallel DEVs cost ~Nx tokens for ~Nx wallclock speedup *if* the split is clean. If slices overlap, you pay Nx for less than Nx benefit and often more bugs. Spend an extra Architect turn on a clean split before parallelizing.

**For mobile (Flutter Agent):** the same pattern applies if the mobile app is large, but in practice mobile apps split less cleanly than backends. Default is one Flutter Agent.

### 6.5 Run Agents in Parallel

Some agents can run simultaneously if they don't depend on each other:

```
                    Team Lead
                       │
              ┌────────┼────────┐
              ▼        ▼        ▼
          PO Agent  Design    DBA Agent        ← Phase 1 (parallel)
          (opus)    Agent     (sonnet)
              │     (sonnet)     │
              └────────┬────────┘
                       ▼
                   DEV Agent (sonnet)          ← Phase 2 (needs Phase 1)
                       │
              ┌────────┼────────┐
              ▼        ▼        ▼
          QA Agent  Security  Perf Agent       ← Phase 3 (parallel)
          (sonnet)  Agent     (sonnet)
              │     (opus)       │
              └────────┬────────┘
                       ▼
                  DevOps Agent (sonnet)        ← Phase 4
```

Prompt for parallel execution:
```
Run these 2 agents in parallel:
1. PO Agent (model: opus): write user stories
2. UI/UX Agent (model: sonnet): analyze screenshots and prepare component specs

When both complete, run these 2 in parallel:
3. Architect Agent (model: opus): write API contract from user stories
4. DBA Agent (model: sonnet): design database schema + migrations

After all 4 complete, spawn DEV Agent with their combined output.
All agents update task_board.md when done.
```

## Quick Reference

### Commands during a session

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model opus` | Switch your session to Opus |
| `/model sonnet` | Switch your session to Sonnet |
| `/status` | Check current model and usage |
| `"Status?"` | Ask Team Lead for project progress |
| `"Add Phase 6: Security Review"` | Extend the workflow |
| `"Spawn Security Agent"` | Add a new agent on-the-fly |

### Tips & Best Practices

| Tip | Details |
|-----|---------|
| **Communicate via files** | Always use `.agent_team/task_board.md` as the single source of truth |
| **Sequential phases** | Phase N output is Phase N+1 input — this ensures quality |
| **Self-contained prompts** | Each agent prompt must include all context it needs |
| **Screenshots for UI** | Paste Figma/design screenshots into chat for pixel-perfect UI |
| **Git after each phase** | Commit after each phase completes for easy rollback |
| **Model = cost control** | Use opus only where deep reasoning matters; sonnet for everything else |
| **No agent limit** | Spawn as many agents as you need — just give each a clear mission |
| **Verify Python version** | Python < 3.9 needs Pydantic v1, `List[]` instead of `list[]` |
